# 42-CPP-CREATOR                                                                

This is a script focuses on helping the 42 students in their cpp proyects. This script was developed between me (jsanfeli in 42 intra) and @RobertoRobrodri
on github (robrodri in 42 intra).

# What it does

CPP Creator recieves the name of the desired cpp class and then proceess to copy from the templates provided the two files required: .cpp and .hpp.
It also generates a very simple makefile.
Then, CPP Creator sets the proper name replacing "Template" with the name you provided.
*This script provides an starting point for your classes. If another template better suits your needs you can always modify the templates from the templates directory



# How to make it work.
   
  -The recomended way is to add a alias to the scrip to be able to use it anywhere you want:
  
  Go to the root directory and edit the .bashrc file and in the last line add.
  
    alias $Desired_Name='/Users/$USER/cpptempcreator/cppcreator.sh
  
  Then, with the name you chooser for the cmd you can execute the script.
  
  #We recommend to hide the directory with a '.' before the directory name.
